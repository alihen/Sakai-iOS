# Vision

I would like Sakai-iOS to provide institutions and students with a seamless experience and build out custom experiences for their students/peers

## Goals for initial (1.0.0) release

- **Support for a majority of Sakai types:** Some Sakai types still need to be implemented, namely:

    - Resources (Content)
    - Assignments
    - Calendar
    - Chat
    - A generic fallback for other tools that cannot be supported due to API constraints.
- **Easy integration testing for institutions:** Integration tests should be easy and comprehensive.
- **Subspec providing UIs for some screens:** The project should provide a CocoaPod subspec that makes integration into an iOS app seamless with a pre-built UI.

## Long term goals

- **Full support for Sakai types/models:** Work with the Sakai core team to build out full support for mobile.
- **Push Notification support:** Work with the Sakai team to implement a Messaging Interface which allows Sakai installations to configure Push Notifications, and implement via a subspec.
